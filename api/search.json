[{"id":"26db5d13c5993d31674f53301da99963","title":"ELK System Deployment","content":"1. PrefaceIn the last blog (ELK and Visualization System), we learned that the ELK system is composed of multiple open source applications. Each application needs to run separately, and finally communicate with each other through the corresponding ip address and port (Such as 172.xxx:3000). So if we need to deploy the entire ELK to a cloud server, it is best to deploy each application in a separate cloud server. This not only improves system stability, but also makes it easier to locate errors when problems occur.This deployment method makes it easier for operation and maintenance personnel to maintain and update the system.\n\n\n2.

These three are the core suites, but the ELK system is often used in collaboration with other open source software (such as Filebeat, Grafana).\n\n\nElasticsearchElasticsearch is a real-time full-text search and analysis engine that provides three functions of collecting, analyzing, and storing data; it is a set of open REST and JAVA API structures that provide efficient search functions and a scalable distributed system. It is built on top of the Apache Lucene search engine library.\nReferenceGuide\n\n\nLogstashLogstash is a tool for collecting, analyzing, and filtering logs. It supports almost any type of logs, including system logs, error logs, and custom application logs. It can receive logs from many sources, including syslog, messaging (such as RabbitMQ), and JMX, and it can output data in a variety of ways, including email, websockets, and Elasticsearch.\nReferenceGuide\n\n\nFilebeatFilebeat is a lightweight shipper for forwarding and centralizing log data. Installed as an agent on your servers, Filebeat monitors the log files or locations that you specify, collects log events, and forwards them either to Elasticsearch or Logstash for indexing.\nReferenceGuide\n\n\nKibanaKibana is a web-based graphical interface for searching, analyzing, and visualizing log data stored in Elasticsearch metrics. It utilizes Elasticsearch’s REST interface to retrieve data, not only allows users to create their own customized dashboard views of data, but also allows them to query and filter data in special ways\nReferenceGuide\n\n\nGrafanaReferenceGuide\n","slug":"ELK-system","date":"2021-12-08T13:39:31.000Z","categories_index":"","tags_index":"tech","author_index":"Troye Huang"},{"id":"bc567916c4dc0d8169bd26d18e348d36","title":"test","content":"nice\n","slug":"test","date":"2021-12-04T16:41:32.000Z","categories_index":"","tags_index":"","author_index":"Troye Huang"},{"id":"c2d67d01ade90af49782566c8eff02c3","title":"Child Photo","content":"This is my photo when i was a child!!!\n\n","slug":"photo","date":"2021-12-04T15:53:23.000Z","categories_index":"","tags_index":"life","author_index":"Troye Huang"},{"id":"b9663f58f18133b35bfe243f3e916a80","title":"Hello World","content":"Welcome to Hexo!
